## Design
1. What type of data is processed and stored?
   - Is it new?
   - Is it a protected type?
2. System hosted On-prem or public cloud?
3. Any new ‘risky’ processes or features?
   - New encryption or authorization?
   - New user functionality?
4. How is the data flow?

## Architecture
1. Tell me about how you’re encrypting xyz?
2. How is data in action accessed and modified?
3. How is data at rest stored?
4. How is data in transit sent?
5. Which APIs are in use?

## Code
1. How is input/output validation implemented?
2. Which libraries/frameworks are in use?
3. Are debug information stripped?
4. Are there any hard-coded secrets?
