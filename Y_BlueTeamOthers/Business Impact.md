*Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact*

*Risk = Likelihood x Impact*

## Risk Strategies

1. Avoid
   - Eliminate risk
2. Transfer: 
   - To insurance company
3. Mitigate
   - Minimize risk to acceptable level
4. Accept
   - In case of low cost asset or low impact

## Risk Monitoring Control

1. Preventative: Before an event occurs
2. Detective: During the event
3. Corrective: After an event
4. Compensating control
   - Used i/o normal control
   - Residual risk should be acceptable risk

## Parameters

**Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**
- Longest period of time being inoperable w/o irrevocable damage

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**
- Length of time to resume normal business

**Work Recovery Time (WRT)**
- Length of time of individual systems to perform reintergration after RTO

**Recovery Point Objective(RPO)**
- Longest period of time to tolerate lost data being unrecoverable

## Disaster Recovery Planning

*An organized in-depth plan how to recover from an incident*

1. Contact Information of PICs
2. Impact Determination
3. Recovery Plan
4. Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
5. Copies of Agreements
6. Disaster Recovery Excercises
7. List of Critical Systems and Data

## Risk Analysis

*Qualitative: Based on Intuition, experience*

*Quantitative: Based on numerical and monetary values*

**SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)**
- Asset Value x Exposure Factor
- SLE = 10.000$ (server) x 20% (power failure risk) = 2000$

**ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)**
- Number of times per year a threat is realized
- Server Power Failure: 3 times

**ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)**
- ALE = SLE x ARO
- 6000$ = 2000$ Ã— 3 times
