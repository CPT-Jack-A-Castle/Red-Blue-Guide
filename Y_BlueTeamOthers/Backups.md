## 1. Full Backup
- Complete backup but time consuming and costly

## 2. Differential Backup
- Takes more time to create but less time to restore
- Only backups data since the last full backup

## 3. Incremental Backup
- Takes less time to create but more time to restore
- Backsup only data changed since last backup

## 4. Snapshots
- Very handy but use a lot of space!


## Differential vs Incremental (after Failure)
