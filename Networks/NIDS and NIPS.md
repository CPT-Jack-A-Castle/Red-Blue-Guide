NIDS: *Network Intrusion Detection System*

NIPS: *Network Intrusion Prevention System*

<br />

## Best Practice
1. Deploy behind the firewall (to reduce work load/false alerts)
2. Deploy in-line
3. Configure Promiscuous Mode to see all traffic

## Fail Open (more common!)
- Let all traffic through once NIPS/NIDS cannot operate properly

## Fail Shut
- Stop all traffic once NIPS/NIDS cannot operate properly
