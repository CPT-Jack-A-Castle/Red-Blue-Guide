*Network Time Protocol*

# RedTeam

## Attack Vectors
1. Correlation of log data on monitoring-systems
2. Time stamp of authentication systems (exp: Kerberos)
3. Validity period of certificates 

**> Information gathering and DOS attacks possible (!)**

## Hierarchical Structure

*Atomic clock -> Stratum1 -> Stratum2 -> ... -> StratumX (End user)

## PDC-Emulator

- First/highest Domain Controller in Active Directory Domain
- Time emitter in whole active directory
- Generally, PDC-Emulator is synchronized with BIOS clock
- Alternatively, PDC-Emulator is synchronized with ext. radio clock / Internet clock

## Information Gathering
- `ntptrace [IPv4]`
- `ntpq [IPv4] peers`
   - shows higher stratum server of NTP target server
- Configuration under `/etc/ntp.conf`

# BlueTeam

## Best Practice
1) Deactivate NTP running service wherever possible 
2) Deactivate unnecessary features
3) Set up FW rules to allow queries only from authorized clients
