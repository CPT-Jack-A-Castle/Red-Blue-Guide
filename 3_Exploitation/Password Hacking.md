## Dump LM/NTLM-Hash via pwdump/FGDump

- pwdump-structure: `<Uname>:<User ID>:<LM hash>:<NT hash>:<Comment>:<Home Dir>:`
- LM Hash for "no password": 
    - "aad3b435b51404ee" "aad3b435b51404ee"

## Rainbow Tables

- Good for LM, NTLM and MD5 Hashes without Salt or Pepper
- Less CPU power, but more storage needed (!) 
   - NTLM hash with [uppercase, lowercase, numbers] and max length of 9 chars = 690GB of space (!)

## Lookups
- Query a database with hashes and passwords
- Easiest way to crack hashes
- Difference between Lookups and Rainbow Tables:
    - Data not stored on your system (no huge disk required)
    - DB contains well known wordlist and breach data (i/o every single combination)

## Pass the Hash (Hash Injection Attack)
- Use dumped hashes for Authen (password not required!)
- `pth-winexe -U [targetUser] //[IPv4] [command]`
- Best Case: User-Account-Control off, Windows Firewall off
- Helpful with LM, NTLM-Authen and SSO-mechanisms

## Wordlists
1. Kali: /usr/share/wordlists (pre-installed)
2. CLI tool crunch
   - `crunch 4 6 abcdefg123! -o crunchlist1.txt`
   - 4 6 = word length between 4 and 6
   - abcdefg123! = use chars out of this list
3. CLI tool cewl
   - custom wordlist generator based on website content
   - `cewl https://cisco.com -m 6 -d 3 -w cisco.cewl`
   - -m = minimum word length
   - -d = depth of sub directories
   - -w = write

## John the Ripper
- `john --wordlist=cisco.cewl --rules --stdout > crunchmutated.cewl`
- `nano /etc/john/john.conf`: configuration of wordlist-rules
- results are saved under .john/john.pot
   - No second run with same wordlist necessary, if a successful search already took place 
- `john --show [wordlist]`: show results
