## Attack Patterns

**DNS Poisoning**
- Modify resolution in DNS's server cache
- Redirect to malicious website

**DNS Enumeration**
- msfconsole `db_nmap -sU -sS -p53 [IPv4/24]`
- Generally speaking, Brute Force against DNS might be possible even with IDS in place 

**Unauthorized Zone Transfers (AXFR)**
- AXFR (Asynchronous Xfer Full Range) is a mechanism for replicating DNS data across DNS servers
- Attackers may request replication to gain information about IPs, Server Names etc.

**Domain Name Kiting**
- Exploit the process of domain name registration (not a real attack)
- Domain name is kept in limbo (5 days period) and cannot be registered by legitimate buyer

## How To

**Kali**
- Forward: `dnsrecon -n [IPv4] -d [Domain] -a` (-a = AXFR)
- Reverse: `dnsrecon -n [IPv4] -r [192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254]`
- Forward: `dig @8.8.8.8 www.example.de A`
- Reverse: `dig -x [IPv4] @8.8.8.8`

**Windows (CMD)**
1. nslookup
2. server [IPv4] [DNS] [Server]
    - Example Server = 8.8.8.8  (Google)
3. set q=any
    - q = query
5. ls -d [Domain] (if you succeed, AXFR will be performed)
