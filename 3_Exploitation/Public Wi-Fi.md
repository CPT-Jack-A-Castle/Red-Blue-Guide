## Best Practices
- Avoidance (!)
- If avoidance is not possible:
   - Use Host-Based Firewall
   - Use VPN
      - avoid internet before VPN is established: E-Mail etc. (!)
   - Use MAC-changer + reconnect hourly to appear as different user
   - Use privacy screens
      - put on laptop display
   - Vary location from where you connect
      - complicate geo location
