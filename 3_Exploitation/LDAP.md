## Best Practice

1) Prefer 636/tcp over 389/tcp for encryption purpose
2) User names in AD should not match with E-Mail addresses
3) Establish PW policy to ensure minimum security level 
4) Disable accounts after several incorrect login attempts 
5) Establish FW rules to allow access to DC and LDAP server only for authorized clients
