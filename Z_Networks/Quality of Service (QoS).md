*Strategic optimization of network performance for different traffic*

## Failures
1. Delay: Time a packet travels from src to dest (ms)
2. Jitter: Uneven arrival/Random delay of packets
3. Drops: Occurs during link congestion (TCP sends again, UDP not)

## QoS Categories
1. Best Effort: first in, first out (no QoS)
2. Integrated Services: Hard QoS, strict bandwidth reservation
3. Differentiated Services: Soft QoS, QoS Mechanisms
4. Classification Traffic: No altering bits
5. Marking Traffic: Alters bits within a frame, cell or packet
6. Congestion Mgmt: Buffer overhead until b.width becomes available
7. Congestion Avoidance: Discard packets if device output full
8. Policing Shaping: Discards packets that exceed speed limit (Allows buffer to delay traffic)
