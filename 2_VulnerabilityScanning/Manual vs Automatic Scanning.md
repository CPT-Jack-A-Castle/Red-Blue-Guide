## Automated Scanning

**Advantages**
1) Fast
2) Low cost
3) Quick overview of target system 
4) Flexible (easy to scale up/down) 

**Disadvantages**
1) Noisy (recognized by IDS/IPS/SIEM)
2) Results may be unprecise (False Positives, False Negatives)
3) Target system stability may get affected (extra NW traffic, new log file entries)
4) No Social Engineering
5) No Pivot-Attack capture

## Manual Scanning

**Advantages**
1) In-depth approach for each host 
2) Allows intelligent searching of sensitive data
3) Can eliminate false positives

**Disadvantages**
1) Longer length of testing
2) Often a more limited scope in terms of  number of systems tested
3) More costly
4) Increased time in getting final deliverable
