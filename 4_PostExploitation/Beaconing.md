## Readme

- Network node that advertise its presence
- Can be legitimate (WAP, NTP, Auto update)
- Can be malicious (C2-communication, Botnet)

## Process

1. Malicious beacon uses ping/heartbeat to verfiy it is active
2. Attackers use DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm), Fast Flux DNS or Jitter
3. After successful Beaconing, C2 server send commands


## Command Channels for Beaconing

1. IRC
    - Declining trend because many organizations block it

2. HTTP/HTTPS
    - Mitigation via intercepting Proxy (MITM)

3. DNS
    - Effective C2 channel because no outside network needed
    - Instead it uses local DNS resolver
    - IOC1: Same query is repeated when bot checks into C2 server
    - IOC2: Commands within response query become longer

4. Social Media
    - Can allow "live off the land" (!)
    - Commands through Twitter / LinkedIn etc. (!)

5. Cloud
    - Botnet can use Google's App Engine to send C2 messages

6. Media/Document Files
    - Metadata within media files can contain C2 messages
