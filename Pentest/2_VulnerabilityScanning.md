# FARADAY
## Info
- Kali Pentesting IDE

## HowTo
### Import Reports
1. CLI: `faraday-client --login`
2. Enter username and pw
3. Create Workspace
4. Import Report

### Tracking with Faraday
1. Create new workspace every quarter and compare over time
2. To understand how your organization is evolving and improving

### Prioritization & Response Phase I (Create)
1. Add hosts, credentials and vulnerabilities after vuln scanning

### Prioritization & Response Phase II (Manage) 
1. Risk Rating (Low, Medium, High)
2. Confirmation of Vulns
3. Determine effort needed for fixing
4. Set up action plan: retest, close vulns or accept risk

# MANUAL VS AUTOMATIC SCANNING
## Info
### Automated Scanning
**Advantages**
1) Fast
2) Low cost
3) Quick overview of target system 
4) Flexible (easy to scale up/down) 

**Disadvantages**
1) Noisy (recognized by IDS/IPS/SIEM)
2) Results may be unprecise (False Positives, False Negatives)
3) Target system stability may get affected (extra NW traffic, new log file entries)
4) No Social Engineering
5) No Pivot-Attack capture

### Manual Scanning
**Advantages**
1) In-depth approach for each host 
2) Allows intelligent searching of sensitive data
3) Can eliminate false positives

**Disadvantages**
1) Longer length of testing
2) Often a more limited scope in terms of  number of systems tested
3) More costly
4) Increased time in getting final deliverable

# VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
## Info
### Preparation
- Scan -> Patch -> Scan (ideally weekly)
- FW/IDS/IPS need exceptions to allow vuln scanners to operate
- Embedded systems can react unpredictable upon Vuln Scanners
- Vuln scans should include both physical and virtual hosts
- Create dedicated account for scanning purpose (i/o admin account)

### VulnScan Software (commercial)

*Requires ongoing paid subscription to access vuln feeds for new vuln signatures*

1. Nessus
2. Qualysguard (cloud based)
3. AlienVault
4. Saint
5. Burp
6. etc.

### Scan types
1. Passive (most stealth, w/o sending probes)
2. Active (consumes bandwidth/ processor resources)
3. Credentialed (discover more vulns)
4. Non-Credentialed
5. Server-based
6. Host-based (less impact on network, less service outages)
7. Internal scan (more insight) vs. External (attacker's perspective)

### Sensitivity
1. Discovery
2. Fast/Basic Assessment
3. Full/Deep Assessment
4. Compliance

### Process Flow
1. Define desired state of security/ scanning-scope/scan sensitivity
2. Create a baseline
3. Prioritize the vulnerabilities
4. Mitigate vulnerabilities
5. Monitor/Retest the network

### Common Identifiers
- CVE (Common Vulnerabilty and Exposure)
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification): maintained by MITRE
- CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)
- CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration)
