# First steps

The focus of this guideline are the well known phases of penetration testing:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Vulnerability Scanning / Enumeration
3. Exploitation (General / Linux / Windows / WebApp)
4. Post Exploitation
5. Covering Tracks

- Topics that are not directly linked to a pentesting phase are covered in:
   - Coding

   - Operating System
   - Wiki
