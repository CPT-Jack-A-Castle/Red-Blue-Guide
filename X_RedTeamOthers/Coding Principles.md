## 1) Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step). “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman

## 2) Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution! To get a good plan, answer this question:
“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!

## 3) Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

"Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul

## 4) Stuck?
The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated. In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
1. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
2. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
3. Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

## 5) Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems! So, what you should do is find an outlet to practice. Something that allows you to solve many micro-problems (ideally, something you enjoy) --> Coding challenges on Codewars ;)
