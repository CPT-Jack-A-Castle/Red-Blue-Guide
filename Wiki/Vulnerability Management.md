# VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
## Info
### Preparation
- Scan -> Patch -> Scan (ideally weekly)
- FW/IDS/IPS need exceptions to allow vuln scanners to operate
- Embedded systems can react unpredictable upon Vuln Scanners
- Vuln scans should include both physical and virtual hosts
- Create dedicated account for scanning purpose (i/o admin account)

### VulnScan Software (commercial)

*Requires ongoing paid subscription to access vuln feeds for new vuln signatures*

1. Nessus
2. Qualysguard (cloud based)
3. AlienVault
4. Saint
5. Burp
6. etc.

### Scan types
1. Passive (most stealth, w/o sending probes)
2. Active (consumes bandwidth/ processor resources)
3. Credentialed (discover more vulns)
4. Non-Credentialed
5. Server-based
6. Host-based (less impact on network, less service outages)
7. Internal scan (more insight) vs. External (attacker's perspective)

### Sensitivity
1. Discovery
2. Fast/Basic Assessment
3. Full/Deep Assessment
4. Compliance

### Process Flow
1. Define desired state of security/ scanning-scope/scan sensitivity
2. Create a baseline
3. Prioritize the vulnerabilities
4. Mitigate vulnerabilities
5. Monitor/Retest the network

### Common Identifiers
- CVE (Common Vulnerabilty and Exposure)
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification): maintained by MITRE
- CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)
- CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration)
