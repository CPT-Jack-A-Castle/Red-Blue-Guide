## Computer Virus
- Requires User Action / Infects when file is opened/executed*
   - Boot Sector
   - Macro
   - Program
   - Multipartite: Combines boot and program Viruses
   - Encrypted: Uses encryption to hide itself
   - Polymorphic: Encrypted virus that alters the decryption module
   - Metamorphic: Polymorphic but able to rewrite itself
   - Stealth: Encyrpted/Polymorphic/Metamorphic
   - Armored: Layer of protection to confuse AV software
   - Hoax: Not real virus but imitation (social engineering)

## Trojaner
- Hidden malicious program which is embedded in other programs to evade security measurements 
- Often implements auto start mechanisms to survive computer restarts 

## Computerw√ºrmer
- Like Virus, but can spread itself even without specific device or user interaction

## Spyware (Adware)
- Secretly gathers information about the user (keylogger etc)

## Rootkit
- Gains administrator level control over a system 
- Target: kernel ring 0 or 1
   - kernel module (Linux) ; .sys-drivers (Windows)
   - `ps -ef` does not show backdoor processes
   - `netstat -nap tcp` does not show C&C connections 
- DLL (Windows) often misused, which then contaminates APIs using these DLLs
- Driver Manipulation (compromising kernel-mode device drivers)

## Spam/Spim
- Spammers often exploit company's Open Mail Relay to send their messages
- USA deployed CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (commercial email regulation)
- Spim: Like Spam but for instant messaging

## Watering Hole
- Malware is placed in a website that you potential victim will access

## MITM
- Man in the Middle

## Backdoor
- Used to bypass normal security and authentication function 

## Logic Bomb
- Malicious code inside a program that executes only subject to certain conditions
- Logic Bombs and Easter eggs do not comply with secure coding standards
