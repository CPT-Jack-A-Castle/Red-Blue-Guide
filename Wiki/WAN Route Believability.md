## Route Believability
- Some routing protocols are considered more believable than others
- Index of believability: Administrative Distance (AD)
- The lower AD the higher the route believability
- If several routing protocols available --> AD is taken into account

## AD Levels
- Directly connected: AD 0
- Statically configured network: AD 1
- EIGRP: AD 90
- OSPF: AD 110
- RIP: AD 120
- External EIGRP: AD 170
- Unknown: AD 255 (unreachable)

## Metrics
- Values assigned to a route: Bandwith, Delay, Speed, Cost, Hop, AD etc.
