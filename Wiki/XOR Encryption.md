## XOR encryption can be very robust if
1. Long non-repeating key (as many bits as plaintext)
2. New key is randomly generated for any new communication
3. Key is kept secret by both the sender and the receiver

## PlainText-Key-Cipher Relation

*If two factors are known, the third can be xored (!)*

## Attention (!)
- Short repeating key results in less secure method
- Cipher text could be decrypted using frequency analysis
