**Going after hackers and uncover their identities** (when organization is under attack)

**Best Practices**
1) Out-of-band communication: Avoid regular communication channels
2) Fake social media profiles
3) Passive info gathering: Avoid tools that send your IP addr to target
4) Need-to-know: Do not tell anyone about analysis except IRT
